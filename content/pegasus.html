This star is called the <strong>North Star</strong> and is the last star on the handle of the <strong>Little Dipper or Ursa Minor</strong>.

 <h6 class="padding-modal">Pegasus' Story</h6>
 <p class="modal-text">The ancient Greeks believed that Pegasus was a <strong>white, winged horse</strong> who sprung from Medusaâ€™s neck when Perseus chopped off her head. Afterward, <strong>Pegasus created a spring or stream just by striking his hoof against the ground</strong>. It was said that those who drank from the spring would be blessed with the gift to write poetry. Zeus, ruler of the Gods, used the horse to carry his <strong>thunder and lightening</strong> and eventually placed Pegasus among the constellations.</p>
