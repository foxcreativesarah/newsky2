 <h6 class="padding-modal">How to find Ursa Major</h6>
 <p class="modal-text"><strong>Ursa Major the Great Bear</strong> is also known as the <strong>Big Dipper</strong>, so look up and try to find a constellation that looks like a <strong>large soup laddle or spoon</strong>. If you can’t find the entire dipper, face north and look for the bright North Star. You can draw a straight line down from the North Star to the two front stars on the Big Dipper (the middle of the bear above.) <strong>You can also measure about 30º with your hand from the North Star to the Big Dipper</strong>.
