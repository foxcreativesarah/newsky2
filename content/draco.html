 <h6 class="padding-modal">Draco's Story</h6>
 <p class="modal-text">Draco represents <strong>Ladon, the dragon</strong>, who guarded the gardens in ancient Greek mythology. Ladon guarded a tree that grew <strong>golden apples</strong> for Zeus’ (ruler of the Gods) wife. Some say that Ladon had 12 heads, but others see him as a single-headed dragon. One day <strong>Hercules</strong>, who was asked to <strong>steal some golden apples</strong> from the tree, <strong>killed Ladon</strong> the dragon with poisoned arrows. Zeus’ wife was saddened by the dragon’s death and placed his image in the sky among the constellations. He is now called <strong>Draco the Dragon</strong>.</p>
