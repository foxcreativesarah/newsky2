 <p class="modal-text"><strong>Orion the Hunter</strong> is the most prominant star group in the southern sky in the winter and contains more bright stars than any other constellation. The hunter of Greek mythology wears a <strong>three-star belt that is easy to spot. Orion’s Belt</strong> also lies about <strong>20º with your hand to the east, from the brightest star in the constellation Taurus the Bull.</strong></p>
 <h6 class="padding-modal">Orion's Story</h6>
 <p class="modal-text">The ancient Greeks thought of Orion the Hunter as the most handsome man. <strong>He was very tall and armed with an unbreakable bronze club.</strong> Orion fell in love with the <strong>Pleiades</strong>, the seven sisters, and started pursuing them. <strong>Zeus, ruler of the Gods</strong>, scooped the sisters up and placed them amoung the stars. Orion can still be seen chasing them across the sky at night.</p>
