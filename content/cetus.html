 <h6 class="padding-modal">How to find Cetus</h6>
 <p class="modal-text"><strong>Cetus the Whale</strong> can be found in the <strong>southern sky</strong> during the winter. It is the fourth largest constellation, so look for it stretching out across the sky. Finding it might be a bit tricky. First look for three bright stars in a row. <strong>These stars are Orion’s Belt. Measure 20º west with your hand</strong>, from Orion’s belt to the bright star <strong>Alderbaran</strong> the ‘Bull’s Eye’ in the constellation, Taurus the Bull. Measure another 30º west with your hand and you will find the stars that make up Cetus the Whale’s head.</p>
