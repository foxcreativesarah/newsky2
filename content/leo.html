 <p class="modal-text"><strong>Leo the Lion</strong> is one of the most recognizable constellations in the sky and <strong>can be found by moving your hand 40º from the back of the Big Dipper (Ursa Major) to the brightest star between the lion’s front paws</strong> called Regulus.</p>
 <h6 class="padding-modal">Leo's Story</h6>
 <p class="modal-text">The ancient Greeks believed <strong>Leo the Lion captured young women</strong> and held them hostage until the warriors from nearby towns would come to fight him. <strong>Leo could not be killed by the warriors’ weapons</strong>, so the women were never rescued until one day <strong>Hercules cornered Leo</strong> in his cave and grabbed the Leo’s front and back paws, breaking the lion’s back at the same time. <strong>The women were now free</strong> and Zeus, ruler of the Gods, cast Leo the Lion into the sky.</p>
